To use the application one ought to have a succesful minikube installation. 

1. For the kubernetes to be accessible through the load balancer one has to run:
*minikube tunnel*

2. To start the cluster run:
*kubectl create -f booktracker_v3.yaml*

3. To get the IP of the website:
*kubectl get svc*

Paste the IP in a browser. If this does not work it should be accessible at: http://IP-ADDRESS

4. To delete or shut down the cluster. Use:
kubectl delete --cascade='foreground' -f booktracker_v3.yaml
